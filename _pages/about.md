Hi, I am **Shuohan Wang**, a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at [South Dakota State University (SDSU)](https://www.sdstate.edu/). I am currently working as a Graduate Assistant for University Housing, managing the University Apartments.

My research interests lie in **Machine Learning**, **Digital Twins**, and **AIGC**. I am passionate about applying AI technologies to solve real-world problems.

In my free time, I am an automotive enthusiast who enjoys DIY car maintenance and exploring cost-effective solutions for vehicle performance. I am also interested in personal finance and investment strategies.
